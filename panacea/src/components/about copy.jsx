            Panacea is the official student-led club of the School Computer and Communication Engineering at Manipal University Jaipur. We promote and inspire innovative
            ideas that shape the leaders of future. We have a driven team that is dedicated to increase the involvement of our School's students by providing an educational forum
            to all members to gain practical experiences by engaging in trainings, workshops, and seminars. This helps them in becoming competent thereby enriching their lives.
            We encourage empathetic people who understand their privilege and are willing to share education and resources with the lesser fortunate people. To that end we have
            conducted many social events where members and professors have taken the initiative to visit the lesser fortunate and introduce them to the computer technology.
            We focus on the overall development of our members by promoting the coding culture. We also promote the study and exploration of computer technology thereby
            uplifting the technical status of the graduates. All the skills that members learn in turn help with the application of computer technologies to attain international
            competitiveness.

            We are dedicated to increasing the involvement of our CCE students towards achieving something extra apart from the daily cut-out syllabi planned for them. In a world
            of high tech advancements, knowledge with implementation becomes mandatory for all budding Engineers of Manipal University Jaipur. The club will act as that
            family where people can learn, share and motivate others to do the same.
